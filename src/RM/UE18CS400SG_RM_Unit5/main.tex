\maketitle

\section{Research Proposal}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Statement of intent on \textbf{what the study is about, why is it important, how it will be conducted and some insights on results}
    \item Concise, coherent summary and plan of proposed work
    \item Submitted to panel after initial studies, use future tense
    \item Helps clear thought process on micro levels -- \textbf{familiarises background, justifies research, helps anticipate timeline, problems, design, experiments}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Format of Research Proposal}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Literature Review}
    \item \textbf{Aim or Objectives}
    \item \textbf{Proposed Methodology}-- justify methods, prove feasibility
    \item \textbf{Proposed Experimental Design}
    \item \textbf{Timeline} -- helps keep design in check, avoids dead time, consult others with work in same field
    \item \textbf{Budget (if applicable)} -- appreciation for research costs, prevents overspending, add explanations for each requirement
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ethics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Research based on trust, be honest
    \item Follow \textbf{Code of Ethics -- IEEE, ACM, 10 Commandments of Computer Ethics}
    \item \textbf{Authenticity and Accuracy} -- report data for which experiments are carried out
    \item \textbf{Originality} -- present your data only, give credits to others
    \item While citing, \textbf{indicate and quote exactly what material is taken from source} reference
    \item \textbf{No plagiarism} -- no self-plagiarism either
    \item \textbf{Accurate, reproducible results} -- include issues, drawbacks, limitations, unexpected and conflicting outcomes
    \item Provide \textbf{authorship based on contribution} to work and content
    \item Ethical treatment of humans and animals
    \item \textbf{Disclosure of conflicts of interest} -- disclose commercial relations, grant proposals, opt for blind reviews (reviewers unknown to authors, authorship removed from paper before review)
\end{itemize}

\section{Plagiarism}

\textit{Appropriation of another personâ€™s ideas, processes, results, words, figures, illustrations without giving appropriate credit.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ethical issue and should be avoided
    \item Software exist to detect parts of a document with plagiarism -- use to improve document
    \item \textbf{Cosine Similarity} used to measure similarity -- $\theta$ gives the degree of similarity
    \begin{equation}
        Similarity = \cos \theta = \frac{\Vec{A}\cdot \Vec{B}}{\left \| A \right \|\left \| B \right \|}
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Human interpretation required because of false positives}
\end{itemize}

\section{Reference Management Tools}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Citations in our work must be according to \textbf{standard formats}
    \item Reference Management Tools \textbf{help organise and manage bibliographic resources, generates text citations and bibliography} as you write
    \item \textbf{Save bibliography from online databases} and can \textbf{switch between formats} easily
    \item Install plugin for integrating tool with word processor, and browser extension for importing references to tool
\end{itemize}

\section{Scientific Misconduct}

\textit{Violation of scholarly conduct and ethical behaviour in publication of scientific research}

Scientific misconduct does not include errors, differences in interpretations, scholarly disagreements, opinions, authorship controversies.

\subsection{Forms of Misconduct}

\subsubsection{Falsification}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Manipulation of research material, processes, or alteration or omission of observed results in an experiment
    \item Most common (over 40\% cases of misconduct)
    \item Used to improve results or remove results contradicting hypothesis
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fabrication}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Invention of data, records or results
    \item Most commonly fabricated documents are consent forms and patient diaries
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Plagiarism}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Copying someone's intellectual property (information or ideas) without citing source
    \item \textbf{Does not distort scientific knowledge} but is not ethical and harmful for careers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reasons for Scientific Misconduct}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Academic, publication and career pressure
    \item Desire for fame, higher positions or financial gain
    \item Sloppy science
    \item Inability to determine right from wrong
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Consequences of Scientific Misconduct}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dismissal from faculty
    \item Rejection of research grants
    \item Blacklisting - from hiring, funding, publications
    \item Removal of past academic achievements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Measures to Maintain Research Ethics}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Before research} -- develop research plan, submit protocols for research review, prepare with research community, agree on authorship, evaluate strength of grant
    \item \textbf{During research} -- Follow approved protocol, gain consent, regularly check data, involve research community, set standards for supervision, communicate expectations, establish an Office of Research Integrity
    \item \textbf{After Research} -- Share report, follow publication ethics like citing correct references
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Why Research Misconduct Matters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Difficult to recognize and prevent
    \item Undermines public trust in research
    \item Corrupts scientific records
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hazards to Good Scientific Practice}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pressure of expectations, evaluation, publication, competition between research groups, positions and grants
    \item Involvement in commercialization, paid opinions, media presence, ambition
    \item Careless experimentation, inadequate and insufficient analysis, testing, awareness, ignorance of errors
    \item Preconceived opinions, failure to see unsuitability of data or results, emotion-driven judgement, arrogance and ambition
\end{itemize}
